heavy_load.c

This program is designed to generate millions of http requests/sec for load testing purposes.

Usage:
     gcc heavy_load.c -o heavy_load
     ./heavy_load <ip> <port> <duration>

Use the IP address of the server you want to send traffic to. (Port 80 for web traffic). <duration> is the number of seconds to run the program.

WARNING: this program can generate enough traffic to overload your http server! It effectively DoS attacks the target with http requests, (which is great for testing, but obviously not something you want to do to a production server).
